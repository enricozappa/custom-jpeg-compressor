# custom-jpeg-compressor
I'm developing this image compressor (actually works only with jpegs) for educational purposes and to automate the process of uploading photos to my [personal photography site](https://enricozappala.com/).

How to use:

1. Clone this repository. 
2. If you don't have them, install NPM and the most recent LTS Node version.
3. Inside the project folder, launch `npm install` from the command line.
4. Put uncompressed jpegs inside **images** folder.
5. Launch `node app.js` from the command line.

Compressed images will be available inside the folder **output**.
