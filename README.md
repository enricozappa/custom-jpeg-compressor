# custom-jpeg-compressor
I'm developing this image compressor (actually works only with jpegs) for educational purposes and to automate the process of uploading photos to my [personal photography site](https://enricozappala.com/).

How to use:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the most recent LTS Node version
3. Install NPM
4. Inside the project folder, launch `npm install` from the command line
5. Put uncompressed jpegs inside **images** folder
6. Launch `node app.js` from the command line
7. Compressed images will be available inside the folder **output**
