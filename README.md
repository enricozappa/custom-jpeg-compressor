# custom-jpeg-compressor
I'm developing this image compressor (actually works only with jpegs) for educational purposes and to automate the process of uploading photos to my [personal photography site](https://enricozappala.com/).

How to use:

1. Clone this repository
 1a. Install the most recent LTS Node Version
 1b. Install NPM
2. Inside the project folder, launch `npm install` from the command line
3. Put uncompressed jpegs inside **images** folder
4. Launch `node app.js` from the command line

Compressed images will be available inside the folder **output**
